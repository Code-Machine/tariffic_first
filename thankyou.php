Refering a business to the promoter (in the form of submitting the necessary details about that business and a person at that business) is what constitutes a single entry into the competition. Subsequent referals constitute additional entries, as do sharing the competition on Facebook (one additonal entry), Twitter (one additonal entry) and LinkedIn (one additonal entry).

            <br />7. The rules of the competition and the prize for each winner are as follows: A successful referal means that the entrant must supply all the required information for a referal and the business the promoter is refered to must exist whilst the key person must still work at that business.
            <br />8. The promoter reserves the right to cancel or amend the competition and these terms and conditions without notice in the event of a catastrophe, war, civil or military disturbance, act of God or any actual or anticipated breach of any applicable law or regulation or any other event outside of the promoter's control. Any changes to the competition will be notified to entrants as soon as possible by the promoter.
            <br />9. The promoter is not responsible for inaccurate prize details supplied to any entrant by any third party connected with this competition.
            <br />10. No cash alternative to the prizes will be offered. The prizes are not transferable. Prizes are subject to availability and we reserve the right to substitute any prize with another of equivalent value without giving notice.
            <br />11. Winners will be chosenat random by the promoter 
            <br />12. The winner will be notified telephonically and by email within 28 days of the closing date. The winner will also be announced on social media on the 31st of October 2015. If the winner cannot be contacted or do not claim the prize within 14 days of notification, we reserve the right to withdraw the prize from the winner and pick a replacement winner.
            <br />13. The promoter will notify the winner when and where the prize can be collected.
            <br />14. The promoter's decision in respect of all matters to do with the competition will be final and no correspondence will be entered into.
            <br />15. By entering this competition, an entrant is indicating his/her agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions.
            <br />16. The competition and these terms and conditions will be governed by South African law and any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of South Africa.
            <br />17. The winner agrees to the use of his/her name and image in any publicity material. Any personal data relating to the winner or any other entrants will be used solely in accordance with current South African data protection legislation and will not be disclosed to a third party without the entrant's prior consent.
            <br />19. Entry into the competition will be deemed as acceptance of these terms and conditions.
